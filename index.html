<h3>What does this page do?</h3>
<p>

Well it keeps changing. I'm just using this as a sort of learning ground for
my kineticJS animations. So whatever this page does currently will be displayed
here.

At the moment it has a classic snake which you can move around using your arrow keys.

I haven't added in the game mechanics for making the snake grow longer when it eats a dot yet.
In fact, there are no game mechanics at the moment apart from it responding to the arrow keys.

But it'll be there soon. :)
