<h3>What does this page do?</h3>
<p>

Well it keeps changing. I'm just using this as a sort of learning ground for
my kineticJS animations. So whatever this page does currently will be displayed
here.

At the moment it displays a graph of the framerate over time.

I just wanted to see how efficient my animations are. It'll have the game of
life simulation. Eventually.
