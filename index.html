Play the classic snake game by using your arrow keys!!

You can make the game go through itself right now because I haven't
added in the game logic to end the game when the snake eats itself. 

So basically, there's no way to loose this game unless you smash into the wall.
At that point the game gets stuck because I haven't added in that feature yet.

So enjoy the game on super easy mode for now!! :D
